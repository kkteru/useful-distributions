Useful distributions
============
Discrete distributions
------------
- **Bernoulli Distribution**: Special case of binomial where only 1 trail is performed
- **Binomial Distribution**: No. of successes on n independent bernouli trials (Tends to Poisson in the limit n tends to infinity and np = \lambda)
- **Multinoulli Distribution**: Generalization of Bernoulli across multiple outcomes
- **Multinomial Distribution**: Generalization of Binomial across multiple outcomes
- **Geometric distribution**: No. of independent bernoulli trials till we get a success
- **Negative Bernouli**: No. of independent bernouli trials till we get r success
- **Poisson Distribution**: Number of events occuring in a fixed interval of time and space.

Continuous distribution
------------
- **Exponential distribution**: Time of occurence of first event. Can be directly derived from Poisson process.
- **Gamma distibution**: Time taken for r events to occur. Can be direclty derived from Poisson process.
